# Swap
swap in  C++ 
This C++ program prompts the user to enter three integer values. It then uses conditional statements and the swap function to arrange the values in ascending order. The program ensures that the smallest value is assigned to value_1, the middle value to value_2, and the largest value to value_3. After sorting the values, it outputs the three values in ascending order.

Key Features:

The program accepts three integer inputs from the user.
It utilizes swap to reorder the values.
The values are displayed in ascending order, ensuring the smallest value appears first.
